## About Github


- Code, docs, issues
- Based around git DVCS
- Free for open source projects, but also private and enterprise services
- Pull requests and other services, e.g. static site hosting, 3rd party integrations
- 12M+ users (developers?), 31M+ repositories https://github.com/about

## About Github
    
- Not only for software development 
- Also ongoing se research

## Software Engineering Courses Usages

- Course material hosting
- Assignemts: code examples and starter code.
- Students' project management (code, docs, tasks)

- Submission & evaluation 
  - e.g., through the pull request mechanism

## Benefits

- Feature rich, especially for team work
- Openness, Transparacy culture, social aspects <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-red" -->
- Reuse and share course content (other instructors, students)
- Industry using anyway
  - Academic licenses
  - building professional portfolio

 ## Limitations
 
- Vendor lock
- Entry barriers, Usability issues with git
- Missing features and services
  - class management
  - e.g., visualization for task management.
  - Forun
  -> 3rd party
- Validity of measurement matrices
- Copyright issues

# Conclusions & Discussion

- Potential for relevant and meaningful learning
  - Especially for software engineering
- Issue of plagiarism in an open knowledge era
- Currently, not friendly enoug
  - Still emerging, e.g., classroom.guthub.com
